Chatbot Project README
======================

Project Overview
----------------

This project involves the development of a chatbot using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user inquiries effectively, providing information, assistance, or performing specific tasks based on the input it receives.

How It Works
------------

1.  **Data Preparation**: The chatbot is trained on a dataset consisting of predefined intents and corresponding text samples. Each intent represents a category of user input that the chatbot should recognize.
    
2.  **Text Preprocessing**: User input is cleaned and preprocessed to extract features. This typically involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stemming or lemmatization.
    
3.  **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. This implementation uses a Bag of Words model, but other techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings can also be applied.
    
4.  **Model Training**: A neural network model is trained on the processed data. The model learns to associate the extracted features with the corresponding intents.
    
5.  **Inference**: When user input is received, it undergoes the same preprocessing and feature extraction steps. The trained model then predicts the intent of the input.
    
6.  **Response Generation**: Based on the predicted intent, the chatbot selects an appropriate response from a predefined list of responses associated with each intent.
    
7.  **Continuous Learning**: The chatbot can be retrained with new data, including feedback from user interactions, to improve its understanding and performance over time.
